In this video, the creator presents a method called Smart GPT which enhances GPT-4's output and shows significant results on official benchmarks. He argues that current benchmark results do not reflect GPT-4's full potential. The Smart GPT system is designed to improve outputs by using three techniques: Chain of Thought prompting, reflection (finding its own errors), and dialoguing with itself.

The presenter demonstrates Smart GPT's effectiveness through several examples, including questions from a TED Talk and creating a high school algebra quiz. Smart GPT consistently provides better results than GPT-4. The creator is also working on a model that automates the entire process, requiring the user to only input a question once. The system can then go through the multi-step process behind the scenes.

The video also mentions an improved prompt that can increase GPT-4's accuracy from 81% to 89%. The prompt is: "Answer: Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to make sure we have the right answer." The presenter plans to explore ways to further improve the Smart GPT model and envisions an entire Council of advisors made up of GPT-4 imitating various experts.

Now let's discuss the theory behind why a system like Smart GPT works. As mentioned earlier, the step-by-step prompt encourages GPT-4 to perform the computation in the input space rather than in the hidden state of the model. By breaking the problem-solving process into stages, Smart GPT allows GPT-4 to focus on each step individually, reducing the chance of getting overwhelmed or confused.

When you combine this approach with the Resolver model, which engages GPT-4 in a dialogue and reflects on the results, it can significantly improve the performance. By doing so, Smart GPT can address approximately half of the errors GPT-4 makes, as evidenced by the test results on the MMLU benchmark.

The step-by-step process and the reflection/dialogue stages work well together because they allow GPT-4 to focus on different aspects of the problem-solving process. The step-by-step prompts help GPT-4 to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. The reflection and dialogue stages allow the model to evaluate its responses, consider alternative options, and arrive at a more accurate final answer.

It's essential to note that the performance improvements provided by Smart GPT are model-dependent. Smaller or weaker models may not benefit from the same level of enhancement. However, with GPT-4, the combination of refined prompts, step-by-step problem-solving, and reflective dialogue seems to be a winning formula.

While Smart GPT-like systems may not yet achieve a 95% accuracy on the MMLU benchmark, they have the potential to surpass the human expert test taker level (89.8%). As these systems continue to evolve and improve, incorporating additional tools and refining the prompting process, they may come closer to reaching the accuracy threshold that some researchers suggest would be indicative of AGI-like abilities.

In conclusion, the Smart GPT approach demonstrates the potential for significant performance improvements in AI models like GPT-4. By combining refined prompts, step-by-step problem-solving, and reflective dialogue, these systems can rectify many of the errors made by the base model and achieve results closer to human expert levels.

In summary, the video discusses ways to improve GPT-4's performance by refining the prompts and using techniques such as step-by-step prompting and engaging in a dialogue with the model. The author explores several academic papers that have contributed to these improvements and theorizes about why these techniques work. The author also highlights potential areas for further improvement in GPT-4, such as:

- Integrating generic few-shot prompts into the model that don't necessarily relate to the topic at hand.
- Using a longer and richer dialogue with multiple "experts" that tap into different weights of GPT-4 to extract more hidden expertise.
- Optimizing the prompts for better performance.
- Experimenting with different temperature settings to achieve a balance between creativity and accuracy.
- Integrating APIs for character counting, calculators, code interpreters, etc., to reduce simple errors made by the model.

The author also points out that OpenAI might not be fully aware of the capabilities of their own model and that there is a need for more thorough testing and falsifiable predictions before releasing models. The author concludes by expressing their hope to integrate GPT-4 into an automatic model for people to test and explore further, as well as their interest in collaborating with experts in benchmarking systems like GPT-4.
