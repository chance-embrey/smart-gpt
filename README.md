## SmartGPT

This repo is a WIP effort to increase the accuracy of GPT-4 using chain-of-thought reasoning and reflection.

The motivation for this project comes from [this YouTube video by AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU).

[Summary.md](Summary.md) contains a summary of the AI Explained's video, generated by giving the video's transcript to GPT-4.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenAI API key (can be obtained [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

## How to use

1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Copy the env file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. In `.env`, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.
4. If you have access to the GPT-4 API, replace `gpt-3.5-turbo` with `gpt-4` for better/more accurate results.
5. Run `python smart-gpt.py` to run the program.
