## SmartGPT

This repo serves as an attempt to increase the accuracy of GPT-3.5/4 using chain-of-thought reasoning and reflection.

The motivation for this project comes from [this YouTube video by AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU).

[Summary.md](Summary.md) contains a summary of the YouTube video that was generated using the audio transcript and GPT-4.
