## SmartGPT

This repo is a WIP effort to increase the accuracy of GPT-4 using chain-of-thought reasoning and reflection.

The motivation for this project comes from [this YouTube video by AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU).

[Summary.md](Summary.md) contains a summary of the AI Explained's video, generated by giving the video's transcript to GPT-4.

## How it works

1. The user submits a query.

2. The query is enhanced with a "chain of thought" prompt by appending "Let's work this out step-by-step to ensure accuracy. What is the answer to the following question?" to the user's query.

3. The new prompt is sent to the OpenAI GPT-4 chat API in several calls, each with different temperature settings, to generate a variety of responses.

4. The received responses are individually sent back to the GPT-4 API for the "reflection and dialogue" phase. The prompt here asks to find any flaws in the given answer.

5. The feedback from the "reflection and dialogue" phase is paired with the initial responses. For each pair, a new API call is made asking the agent to use the feedback and correct the answer.

6. Finally, all corrected responses are sent back to the GPT-4 API in the "resolver" phase. The AI is tasked with choosing the most accurate response. The prompt for this call is "Given these corrected responses, select the most accurate answer. Question: {question} Responses: {corrected_responses}"

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenAI API key (can be obtained [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

## How to use

1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Copy the env file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. In `.env`, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.
4. If you have access to the GPT-4 API, replace `gpt-3.5-turbo` with `gpt-4` for better/more accurate results.
5. Run `python smart-gpt.py` to run the program.
